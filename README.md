# DigitalCrafts Reference App

This project aims to give students a Full Stack Application that they can reference as best-practice example of a large project.

Each section of the project is divided up into subfolders representing the frontend and backend for each technology. Each folder is an individual package and includes instructions on getting up and running. Additional technologies will be added in future, with

## Backend

- [Express (primary example) - `./server-express`](./server-express)
- [ASP.Net - `./server-asp.net`](./be-asp.net)

## Frontend

- [React (primary example) - `./client-react`](./client-react)
- [Vue - `./client-vue`](./client-vue)
